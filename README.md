# Sysro-Tuition-Management-System
 In a university group project, our team successfully developed a  Student Management and Performance System using the MERN  stack. This comprehensive system enables educational  institutions to efficiently handle student, teacher, and parent  records, monitor student performance, and generate insightful  reports on academic progress.
